Trie : It is a tree like data structure.It has multiple names according its uses.Like we also call it prefix tree(as we know prefix means very first part of a String/word like disable , dislike etc here dis is prefix.So when we are using same combination of words many times in a word we can save it in one place and use this again and again) , retrieval tree(as they help us in retrieving data from strings) and also call it dgitial trees.In fact trie came from retrieval and they are tree in real.
We use tries in solving some problems related to strings.

Let suppose we have data "the","a","there","any","thee" , "their"
we want to store it in a trie then we will store it like this
Note:Our root node in tries is always an empty node.

                                    emptyNode
                                    /       \
                                   t         a
                                  /           \
                                 h              n
                                /                \
                           r-i-e                  y
                              / \
                             r   e
                            /
                           e

Here we will se that don't store our prefixes twice we use them just once.
And also we will see that our tree is not a binary tree.We call such type of trees k-ary tree.Mean here number node can be any value.We can make many childs of any node.
So here time colplexity for many operations also reduces due to balanced height.
