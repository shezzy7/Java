//In recursion whenever a function is repeatedly called then it occupies memory.For example when a function is setted as recursive and we pass some parameters though it as these parameters occupy some space in memory so when we don't have any base condition at which our recursionn must stop then recursion becoome infinite and our memory is filled up and don't have any space to store some data this is the state when stack overflow occurs and an error is generated of stack overflow.So to prevent our programm from stack overflow we must right a base condition at which our function returns and stop more execution.
