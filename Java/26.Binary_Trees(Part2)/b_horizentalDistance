Tress have a property named horizental distance.
Horizontal Distance (HD): This is the measure of how far left or right a node is from the root. The root node itself is assigned a horizontal distance of 0.
When moving to the left child of a node, the horizontal distance decreases by 1.
When moving to the right child, the horizontal distance increases by 1.

            1 (HD=0)
            / \
   (HD=-1) 2    3 (HD=1)
         /       \
(HD=-2) 4        5 (HD=2)
Node 1 (the root) has HD = 0.
Node 2 is the left child of 1, so its HD is -1.
Node 3 is the right child of 1, so its HD is +1.
Node 4 is the left child of 2, so its HD is -2.
Node 5 is the right child of 3, so its HD is +2.
