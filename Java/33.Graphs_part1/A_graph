     Graph is implemented in many application like google maps etc.

      Types of edges:-
        Edges can be Uni-directional Or Bi-directional.Uni directional mean we can go from one vertix to other but can't move back like from second to first vertix.
        In Bi-directional edges we can move in any direction forward or backward.Uni directional edges  are like one way road , while bi-directional are like two way road.We also call bi-directional as un-directed edges.

        Each edge can contain some weight(+ve/-ve).Graph
        And those graphs whose edges contain some weight are called weighted graphs and others are called un-weighted graphs.Weight can be positive or negative value.
        Weight is not like kgs etc.It is just a value setted for a specific edge connecting to vertices.
