public class A_graph {
    
    /*  Graph:-A graph is a network of nodes , in which multiple node are connected tohether with help of edges.Each node in graph is called vertex, and each connecting line connecting a vertex to other is called edge.
     Graph is implemented in many application like google maps etc.

      Types of edges:-
        Edges can be Uni-directional Or Bi-directional.Uni directional mean we can go from one vertix to other but can't from second to first vertix.In Bi-directional edges we can to both vertices from any vertix.Uni directional are like one way road , while bi-directional are like two way road.We also call bi-directional as un-directed edges.

        Each edge can contain some weight(+ve/-ve).Graphs those edges contain some weight are called weighted graphs and others are called un-weighted graphs.Weight can be positive or negative.So can see them in pics given here.
        Weight is not like kgs etc.It is just a value setted for a specific edge connecting to vertices.
