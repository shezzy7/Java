        //Time complexity:-It is the measurement of time in which a programm completes its execution.Basically whatever we write in our code our pc/laptop takes a time to execute this code.So this time is called time complexity.And we have to write such a code that should take minimum tike to execute.And this time is in milliseconds.Time complexity matters more when we write code for some big application.Foor example Facebook,google,instagram etc.As we see millions of people are using them at a time but it does not effect their response time.It's due to their code written in such a efficient way that it takes very low time to respond. 

        //Space complexity:- It refers to amount of memory our code uses.So we have to write such an effiecient code that it should occupy minimum space in the memory.

        //Order complexity Analysis :- We analyse a code on the basis of time comlexity and space complexity.If a code has less time and space complexity then it means it is a good programm else less good.
        //Amount of time and space taken up by an algorithm/code as function of input.Not the actuall time taken.
