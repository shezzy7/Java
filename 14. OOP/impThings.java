//Note:In java we declare classes as public,default but we can't make any class private or protected
//And we can make our constructors,attributes,fields and sub-classes as default,public,protected or private.
//If we have created a child class of a parent class.And we want to create object of child class using reference of parent class then we can do this for example in main function if i create object  as->  Parent c = new Child();  . Then it's valid but we can't create object of parent class using reference of child class like         -> Child p = new Parent(); so its unvalid.
//If we have declared any static type variable in our class then we can also access this variable using class name.
