            //Queue
//Queue is one of the linear data structures.By its meaning it means a line.It works on 'FIFO' principle which means 'First in first out'.Like a queue in which peoples are standing for geeting ticket of a theater here we will see that peoples can some from end of the queue but people on front of queue get ticket first which basicaly means first-in-first-out.So by seeing this we can imagine that Queue is a data structure in which we can insert data from one send which is called rare(back) and can get data from front of queue only.

            //Operation
//We perfomr three basic operation on a queue
//i-Add():- It is used for adding an element in queue.It is known as 'enque'.It add element from rare side.Works in O(1).
//ii-Remove():- It is used for removing an element from queue.It is known as 'dequeue'.It removes element from from side.Works in O(1).
//iii-Peek():- It is used for getting  an element front element's value.It doesn't removes an element from queue it only returns value of front element.Works in O(1).
//Note: 'deque' is different form 'dequeue'.'deque' means a double ended queue in which we can add and remove elements from both sides.And 'dequeue' mean removing element from rare side of single ended queue.

            //Implementation
//We can implement queue using Arrays,Linkedlist and Stack.
